# NLP_word_embedding_space_ML_segmentation
This is a project that aims to understand how semantic knowledge, our general knowledge of the world, influences our memory. I use word embeddings from Natual Language Processing GloVe to quantify semantic similariy of words. This script shows one approach I have tried to segment word embedding similarity matrix into sub-clusters by k-means clustering. Because this is an unsupervised method, I use silhouette coefficients to compare clustering results using different k.
