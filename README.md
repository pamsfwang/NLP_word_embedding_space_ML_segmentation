# NLP_word_embedding_space_ML_segmentation
This is an example script for a study aims to understand how semantic knowledge, our general knowledge of the world, influences our memory. I use word embeddings from Natual Language Processing to quantify semantic similariy of words. This script shows one approach I have tried to segment word embedding similarity matrix into sub-clusters by k-means clustering.
